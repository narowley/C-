# Overview

I believe that a key part of any software engineer's capabilities include the ability to adapt and overcome. It's impossible to be adaptable if you only have one skill set in one single language. Each language has its own habits and own ways of handeling issues. We can use this knowledge of how one langauges handles a challenge to affect the way that another problem in another language is handled. This is why I continue to develop my skill set and broaden my horizons of possible languages to learn.

To increase my skill set, I used tic-tac-toe as my way to learn C#. The point of the game is to achieve three in a row in a three by three grid. Two players play and alternate by placing X's and O's on the board.

My purpose for writing this program was so that I can understand how I can apply my prior knowledge of programming to a new language. I've made tic-tac-toe before, but in python, so I already knew how to make a functioning version of this game; however, I didn't know how to apply this knowledge outside of python. This gave me a great way to take what I already know and apply it to a different context.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

To develop this, I used Visual Studio Code to code my program, .NET to run my program, and C# to act as my language. No additional libraries were used or required.
